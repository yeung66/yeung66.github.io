Since I hadn't updated my blog in the past two months and was too busy to check, I hadn't noticed the issue. After publishing a new post yesterday, I realized today that the view count was still zero. I opened &lt;a href="https://app.follow.is/share/feeds/55149012216215581">Follow&lt;/a> and found that Follow was also having trouble fetching the RSS feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I received the email, I tested the RSS feed locally, and it opened without any issues. Then I checked the error logs provided by NJU-LUG Blogroll, which indicated a timeout error. My initial guess was that there might be an issue with the CDN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I logged into Upyun to inspect the CDN settings and eventually discovered a configuration option for &lt;strong>Acceleration Regions&lt;/strong>. The default setting was &amp;quot;Domestic Acceleration,&amp;quot; which routes overseas requests to domestic CDN nodes. It seemed the problem lay here—overseas access (e.g., GitHub Action) might have been unable to reach Upyun's domestic CDN nodes recently, resulting in timeouts and the inability to fetch the RSS feed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After changing the configuration to &amp;quot;Global Acceleration,&amp;quot; I retried fetching the RSS feed in Follow, and the issue was resolved successfully.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Blog/">Blog</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/GitHub/">GitHub</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/rss/">rss</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Notes/">Notes</category></item><item><title>Walking on Thin Ice</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/walking-on-thin-ice/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/walking-on-thin-ice/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:20:02 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>Because I had a bit of leave left, I wrapped up my workdays for the year yesterday. Of course, that only means I don’t have to physically go to the office for the rest of the year—there’s still work to be done. In fact, I even had to troubleshoot issues and respond to messages from U.S. colleagues at noon on Saturday due to the time difference. It’s been a while since I last updated, so I thought I’d take this chance to summarize and vent a little about work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m about to hit the one-and-a-half-year mark as a rookie in the workplace. Looking back on this time, the overwhelming feeling is—panic. Anxiety and panic. Worrying about not being able to handle tasks, worrying about potential issues, worrying about system failures or financial risks. It truly feels like walking on thin ice, where every step has to be taken with extreme caution, fearing that I might step into a trap. On one hand, there are many external factors beyond my control; on the other hand, the scope of the business systems is just too vast, with countless edges and corners where details can be easily overlooked. It feels like no matter how careful you are, problems can still arise—some of which might be completely out of your control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pressure-of-not-making-mistakes">The Pressure of &amp;quot;Not Making Mistakes&amp;quot;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main reason for this constant panic is the pressure of &amp;quot;not making mistakes.&amp;quot; In a large company, the cost of making a mistake is just too high. One system failure or financial loss could directly result in a poor performance review—or even being &amp;quot;let go.&amp;quot; Even if it doesn’t come to that, in such a competitive and cutthroat environment, a single mistake can significantly impact your chances of promotion and career development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this isn’t just an issue in the tech industry. A few days ago, I read a news story about a lawyer who forgot to inform their client to pay an additional 5 yuan in court fees. The client sued them for arbitration, and the lawyer ended up compensating over a million yuan. The legal profession is another high-risk field. This made me realize even more deeply that some professions simply have an incredibly high cost of error—you just can’t afford to make mistakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blurred-lines-between-work-and-life">Blurred Lines Between Work and Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apart from the pressure of &amp;quot;not making mistakes,&amp;quot; what exhausts me the most is how hard it is to separate work from life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, there’s the issue of working hours. Late nights at work have become the norm. Sometimes, I work overtime until after 10 p.m., and by the time I get home, there’s barely enough time to wash up and sleep—leaving no room for personal life. Even on rare occasions when I leave work early, there’s always someone who needs to reach out to me for something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, everyone plays a role in the overall business chain. If you don’t complete your task, it holds up others; conversely, if someone else doesn’t finish their task, you’re stuck too. To avoid delays, you sometimes end up disturbing others at inconvenient times, like evenings or weekends. Of course, this kind of disturbance is mutual—I often get bombarded with messages during my own downtime as well. Over time, the boundaries between work and life become increasingly blurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the end of the day, work is still just work. We work to earn money, and we earn money to live. My future goal is to find a less stressful industry or role where mistakes are more tolerable and the pressure isn’t so high. &lt;del>Of course, the ideal scenario would be not having to work at all.&lt;/del> Who knows when I’ll finally be able to live off passive income? Hopefully, it won’t take until retirement (though there’s no guarantee I’ll even make it to retirement).&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Life/">Life</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Essay/">Essay</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Work/">Work</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Complaints/">Complaints</category></item><item><title>Arc Bookmark Export</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/export-arc-bookmarks/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/export-arc-bookmarks/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 20:02:42 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>Recently, I've been thinking about switching back to Edge browser from Arc. Naturally, changing browsers requires migrating usage history data from Arc, with bookmarks (or &amp;quot;Pined Tabs&amp;quot; as Arc calls them) being the most important. However, after searching around, I couldn't find an export option. A quick search revealed that the Arc browser, which uses the Chromium engine, indeed lacks a bookmark export feature (&lt;a href="https://sspai.com/post/81942">The shame of Arc browser's user experience: unable to export saved websites&lt;/a>)...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to an article on SSPai, the browser itself does not have a bookmark export function. You can only find the data file in the application directory, specifically at &lt;code>/Users/{your username}/Library/Application Support/Arc/StorableSidebar.json&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://scottyeung.top/my-images/202410012019733.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exported data file contains the URLs and titles of the Pined tabs. However, this JSON data format cannot be directly imported into Chrome/Edge browsers and needs to be converted into the corresponding HTML format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the comments section of the SSPai article, someone posted a conversion page, but after trying it out, I found that the group names and hierarchy of the bookmarks were lost. So, I wrote one myself. You can try it out. Just find the file at the path mentioned above, copy the text content, and paste it into the webpage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The address is: &lt;a href="https://scottyeung.top/arc-bookmarks-export/">https://scottyeung.top/arc-bookmarks-export/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Supports exporting bookmarks according to hierarchical grouping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will also export open tabs and fixed application tabs on the Pined Tab
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>However, these exported tabs are not distinguished and are placed at the bottom of the outermost group&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, it's best to close any open tabs in the Arc browser before exporting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Tools/">Tools</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Rant/">Rant</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Software/">Software</category></item><item><title>LeetCode: Make a Square with the Same Color</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/3127-leetcode/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/3127-leetcode/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 11:25:27 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;h2 id="problem">Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>source: &lt;a href="https://leetcode.cn/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color/description/">3127. Make a Square with the Same Color&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>difficulty: easy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are given a 2D matrix grid of size 3 x 3 consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a 2 x 2 square where all cells are of the same color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Return true if it is possible to create a 2 x 2 square of the same color, otherwise, return false.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="constraints">Constraints:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>grid.length == 3&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>``grid[i].length == 3`&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>grid[i][j] is either 'W' or 'B'&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The problem can be transformed into determining whether there exists a 2 * 2 matrix within a 3 * 3 matrix that contains 3 or 4 identical elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that the matrix is only 3 * 3, it can be directly divided into 4 blocks, and we can simply check whether any of these 4 blocks meet the condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kotlin">Kotlin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Directly check which blocks each point belongs to. However, the if statements for these checks are quite ugly (after writing one, I ended up using GitHub Copilot to generate the rest).&lt;/p>

We had a lot to talk about. The railway department, a traditional state-owned enterprise, doesn't seem much different from the unit system in terms of work. Although there are indeed professional aspects to the job, the core elements seem to be party building and publicity. All these things sound very interesting to someone like me who works in the volatile internet industry. Many of the so-called stereotypes about the system are, to some extent, quite reasonable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most memorable part of our conversation was about work and promotion. I asked my classmate out of curiosity, &amp;quot;What growth and gains have you achieved over the years of working? Or what would you say is your core competitiveness when it comes to promotions or job-hopping?&amp;quot; The point of my question was to understand what skills my classmate has acquired and improved in his work, what he possesses that others don't, or what he has that others also have. (Naturally, I thought about what could be shown off in a job interview when job-hopping.) However, his answer was: connections, face-time, and the skills that could be related to, perhaps, article writing, video editing, and being able to do anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After hearing his answer, my first thought was that these things are only applicable within this system. If one leaves this system, wouldn't all these be wasted? But why would one leave this system? As my classmate said, once you enter the unit, you basically won't be fired, and they take care of your life, old age, sickness, and death. Under such circumstances, the individual and the collective are firmly tied together. The collective promises not to abandon the individual, and the individual is not willing to leave the collective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having worked for less than a year, I honestly feel a bit tired of working in the internet industry, dealing with a makeshift team, doing uninteresting tasks, and often under great pressure. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the company or the industry, but the turnover rate is really high. Some of those who joined at the same time as me have already left. Where can they go? But at least they can leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know the state-owned enterprise system is attractive, but I really can't accept a job without an exit mechanism. What if something inappropriate happens? Can I find a job after I quit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, if all else fails, there's always the civil service to fall back on. Could it be that the final destination is the civil service? It seems I can start brushing up on some questions.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Essay/">Essay</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Rants/">Rants</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Miscellaneous/">Miscellaneous</category></item><item><title>Reading Notes on 'Glucose Revolution'</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/control-sugar/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/control-sugar/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 16:25:47 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36707112/?_dtcc=1">Douban: Glucose Revolution&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Core: To control and slow down the emergence of blood sugar peaks, it is necessary to maintain a steady blood sugar level and reduce large fluctuations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dangers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Glycation and inflammation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Damage to the liver and pancreas&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some small tips&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Eating order: vegetables, protein and fat, and finally carbohydrates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drinking a little vinegar before or during meals can help&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simple exercise after eating can inhibit the appearance of blood sugar peaks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put on a coat: Mixing some protein and fat when eating carbohydrates can also help&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="notes">Notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Chapter 13 Part 2 What are the dangers of glucose peaks&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lowering glucose peaks can prevent the occurrence of inflammation, thereby reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 15 7 From Head to Toe How Glucose Peaks Make Us Sick&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the long run, the formation process of glucose peaks can cause oxidative stress, glycation, inflammation, and excessive insulin response, leading to various chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, arthritis, depression, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Too much glucose can stop mitochondria from working, and then energy production will be affected, resulting in us feeling extremely tired.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 17 8 Tip 1 Correct Eating Order&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you eat foods containing starch, fiber, sugar, protein, and fat in a certain order, you can not only reduce your overall glucose peak by 73%, but also reduce your insulin peak by 48%. And this is true whether or not you have diabetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>So, what is the correct order of eating? That is, eat fiber first, then protein and fat, and finally starch and sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 18 9 Tip 2 Add a Green Appetizer Before Each Meal&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you really have to wait, don't exceed 3 hours. This is because fiber usually takes 2 hours to pass through the stomach and upper small intestine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 20 11 Tip 4 Smooth Blood Sugar Curve After Breakfast&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Breakfast is the worst time to eat sugar and starch foods, but most people only eat sugar and starch foods for breakfast.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 23 14 Tip 7 Drink Some Vinegar Before Eating&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Drinking a big glass of water mixed with a tablespoon of vinegar a few minutes before eating sweets will make the subsequent glucose and fructose curves smoother. In this way, appetite will be suppressed, and more fat will be burned at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Drinking vinegar juice within 20 minutes before or after meals, or drinking it while eating, has a similar effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 24 15 Tip 8 Get Moving After Meals&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Now, you know the magical combination of eating sweets without causing a surge in glucose in the body: drink vinegar juice before meals, and exercise more after meals.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Some excerpts and notes from reading &amp;quot;The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="knowing-is-not-the-same-as-doing">Knowing is not the same as doing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Financial success is not a hard science, but a soft skill - how you do it is more important than how much knowledge you have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An individual investor's willingness to take risks depends on early personal experiences. What determines the outcome in investing is not intelligence, not education or experience, but the time and place where a person is born - &lt;strong>purely luck factors&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="survival-first">Survival first&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Getting rich requires a spirit of adventure, an optimistic attitude, and the courage to let go. But what needs to be done to keep wealth is completely opposite to adventure. Keeping wealth requires humility and awe, a clear understanding of how quickly wealth comes and how easily it goes. Keeping wealth requires frugality and acknowledging that part of the wealth you have comes from luck, so don't expect to replicate past successes indefinitely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survival should be the basis of all your strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No return is worth the risk of losing everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only take advantage of the value of compound interest if you survive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="tail-events">Tail events&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tail events have a huge impact in these areas. These low-frequency, high-impact minority events become the main factors determining the outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;What matters is not whether you are right or wrong,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;financial tycoon&amp;quot; George Soros once said, &amp;quot;but how much you can make when you are right, or how much you will lose when you are wrong.&amp;quot; Even if you are wrong half the time, you can still win in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="money-and-time">Money and time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The greatest intrinsic value of money is that it gives you the ability to control your own time - there is no exaggeration in this statement. The reason why you can gradually gain a certain degree of independence and autonomy from the process of wealth accumulation is that the wealth you accumulate gives you stronger control over what you can do and when you can do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don't have much control over time, you have to accept opportunities that are not good enough, but if you have enough time, you can wait for better opportunities to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="facing-the-unexpected">Facing the unexpected&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The truth you should learn from unexpected events is: unexpected things happen every day. We should not take past events as a guide to future possibilities; in the face of unexpected events, we should acknowledge this - we know nothing about what will happen in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the face of the unexpected, safety margins need to be set. The purpose of the safety margin is to make prediction unnecessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If something has a 95% chance of success, the remaining 5% failure rate means that at some point in your life, you will definitely encounter failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save money. Just save. Saving money doesn't need any specific reason. It's a good thing to save for a car, a down payment, or a sudden illness, but one of the best reasons to save is for those unpredictable or undefined things. Everyone's life is made up of a series of surprises. In the worst moments of life, a substantial savings without a specific purpose can provide a hedge for the inevitable surprises.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-cost-of-investment">The cost of investment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The success of investment requires investors to pay a corresponding price, but the measure of this price is not money, but volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret - these costs are easily overlooked by you if you are not the one facing them directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all volatility is a cost, not a penalty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Most of the costs to be paid in finance are unpriced. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the financial world. They are usually worth your bill, but you should see them as a cost (to be paid for good things), not a penalty (to be avoided at all costs).&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="choices-vary-from-person-to-person">Choices vary from person to person&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When a commentator on CNBC tells you &amp;quot;you should buy this stock,&amp;quot; remember that they don't know who you are. Are you a teenager who plays stocks as a game, an elderly person with a limited budget who has lost a spouse, or a hedge fund manager who wants to boost performance before the end of the quarter? Should we think that these three people have the same priority in thinking and believe that the trading price of a stock, no matter how high, is reasonable for each of them?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-temptation-of-pessimistic-attention">The temptation of pessimistic attention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If a person who has always been smart tells me that the price of the stock he chose will increase 10 times next year, I will consider it a dream without hesitation. But if a person who is always confused tells me that the price of a stock I hold will plummet because the company is exposed to fraudulent accounting, I will put down all my work and listen carefully to every word he says.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Progress happens too slowly to be noticed, but setbacks happen too quickly to be ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to data from the National Institute of Health, since 1965, the age-specific death rate from heart disease in the United States has dropped by more than 70%. A 70% drop means that 500,000 lives are saved each year. Compare this with the population of some big cities to get a sense of how many lives are saved each year. But because this process progresses slowly, it attracts less attention than the losses caused by sudden events such as terrorist attacks, plane crashes, or natural disasters. Even if the United States were to experience 5 Katrina hurricanes a week - imagine how much attention that would attract - the total number of deaths in a year would not offset the number of lives saved each year behind the 70% drop over the past half-century.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="authors-philosophy">Author's philosophy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Be humble when things are going in the right direction; be understanding or sympathetic when things are going in the wrong direction. This is because nothing is as good or bad as it seems. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are real and hard to discern, so keep this in mind whether you're evaluating yourself or others. If you can respect the power of luck and risk, you're more likely to focus on what you can really control and find the right reference points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most investors, dollar-cost averaging into low-cost index funds will be the highest probability of long-term investment success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the field of investment, there is almost no relationship between effort and results. This is because the world is driven by tail events - a few variables are the source of most returns. No matter how hard you invest, as long as you miss two or three opportunities that can completely turn the situation around, your returns won't be too outstanding. But on the other hand, as long as you're lucky and seize these opportunities, even if you don't invest seriously at ordinary times, you can easily get rich. As long as you grasp a few key points that are crucial to the success of your strategy, even the simplest investment strategy will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>High savings rate, patience, and an optimistic attitude that the global economy will continue to create value over the next few decades.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Reading/">Reading</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Money/">Money</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Investment/">Investment</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Notes/">Notes</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Life/">Life</category></item><item><title>Remove Copyright Information from Copied Content in Apple Books</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/remove-copyright-from-apple-books/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/remove-copyright-from-apple-books/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 22:38:11 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>Recently, I've been reading on Apple Books on my computer. The experience is decent, but there's one annoying aspect when taking notes: When you copy content from a book, Books automatically adds quotation marks and appends copyright information. This can't be removed through citation settings, which means that every time you paste a note, you have to manually delete this extra information. It's quite a hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;If there is evidence that allocating empty sets can harm performance, it can be avoided by repeatedly returning the same immutable empty set, because immutable objects can be freely shared (Item 17). The following code does just that&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Excerpt From

This material may be protected by copyright.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I looked online and found quite a few people complaining about this. Everyone seems to handle it externally, with the main solution being the use of Automator.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/137047/dont-want-ibooks-to-always-paste-the-excerpt-from-of-what-i-have-copied">Don't want iBooks to always paste the &amp;quot;Excerpt From&amp;quot; of what I have copied&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="automator">Automator&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Automator is an automation tool that comes with macOS. You can arrange actions inside it to automate operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For our need to remove copyright information, the overall idea is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Get the text content from the clipboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extract the original text content from the text.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>This can be achieved through a JavaScript script.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return the extracted content back to the clipboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It sounds simple, just like the three steps to put an elephant into a fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://scottyeung.top/my-images/202403282257812.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After setting up Automator, you can add a shortcut to the new service (Quick Action) in the system's shortcuts, and then trigger it in the application. &lt;strong>However, after setting it up, no matter what shortcut I tried, I couldn't trigger it successfully, so I gave up on this method.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="raycast">Raycast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since we're using scripts anyway, why not go through an extra process and use Raycast to write a script for the conversion? This way, we don't have to set and remember extra shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After copying the content from Books, execute the Raycast script to convert the clipboard content. The main trouble here is that Node.js does not natively have an API to directly access the clipboard. Here, I borrowed the implementation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/clipboardy">clipboardy&lt;/a>, which accesses the clipboard by calling command line commands.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;p>It's straightforward: use exec to execute command line commands to get clipboard content, then use regular expressions to extract the text content, and write it back to the clipboard after successful extraction. What's even better is that the above code was directly written by ChatGPT for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the code looks simple, debugging took me a long time. At first, I directly ran the script in the command line after writing it, and it worked fine. However, when I started it from Raycast, the result was problematic, and I couldn't match it no matter what. After logging the full text output, I found that the output was garbled. Obviously, there was an encoding problem. In the end, I manually added &lt;code>env: { ...process.env, LANG: &amp;quot;en_US.UTF-8&amp;quot; }&lt;/code> to set the environment variable for encoding, and the problem was solved. It seems that AI is still not familiar enough with the Chinese environment 😂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After adding this encoding environment variable setting, the problem was solved 🛫, and I can continue to enjoy reading and taking notes on Books.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Apple/">Apple</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/AI/">AI</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Tools/">Tools</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Productivity/">Productivity</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/JavaScript/">JavaScript</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/macOS/">macOS</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Complaints/">Complaints</category></item><item><title>Vue3 Slot</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/vue3-slot/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/vue3-slot/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:02:50 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>In Vue components can set a slot tag in the template, which is used to pass some content when using this component to replace the slot.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;p>The content passed to the slot can be text or an HTML element.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scope">Scope&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The rendering scope of the slot is limited to the parent component. When a variable is passed in, this variable can only access the parent component and cannot access the variables of the child component.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Expressions in the parent template only have access to the parent scope; expressions in the child template only have access to the child scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In some cases, the content of the slot needs to be set according to the variables of the component itself. In this case, attributes can be passed to the component like passing props to the component. At this time, the content of the slot can be obtained according to the variables of the child component.&lt;/p>
