I've been using it sporadically for several years, but syncing/backup can be quite troublesome, especially across multiple devices of different system types. Both Logseq and Obsidian operate by loading a local folder as the note repository, so syncing notes essentially means syncing this folder. However, achieving a seamless experience across different systems and devices can be a bit of a hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s a summary of the various stages I’ve gone through, trying different methods at each stage, none of which worked perfectly. In the end, I opted for the official sync feature, which costs $5 per month.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="syncing-between-pcs-using-onedrive">Syncing Between PCs Using OneDrive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I first started using Logseq, I only used it on my computer and didn’t even think about checking or taking notes on my phone. At that time, I only needed to sync notes between two PCs. This was relatively simple—just choose a cloud storage service that supports real-time folder syncing, such as OneDrive or Nutstore. I used OneDrive back then, and the syncing was smooth. Since I rarely edited notes on both devices simultaneously, I didn’t encounter major issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="syncing-using-icloud">Syncing Using iCloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Later, I switched to an iPhone and needed to sync notes between my iPhone and PC. Naturally, I considered using iCloud for syncing, as iCloud can also be installed on Windows for syncing. Initially, I used iCloud to sync between my iPhone and Windows PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, iCloud syncing often caused issues, especially on Windows devices. Sometimes, files would have multiple versions due to sync problems during normal use. Occasionally, a file version would fail to download for unknown reasons. When this happened, Logseq would get stuck trying to download the file, freezing the interface and crashing the program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To resolve this, I had to manually locate and delete the problematic files in the iCloud storage directory. Obsidian also faces similar issues, but these freezes only occur when opening the software, not during use. Additionally, identifying and deleting duplicate files in the iCloud directory is nearly impossible on mobile devices. If this issue arises while using the app on a phone, it’s essentially unresolvable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After switching my PC to a Mac, these sync conflicts and multi-version issues largely disappeared. However, I encountered another issue during actual use: file syncing and retrieval could be delayed. For example, if I wrote a journal entry on the computer today, the phone might not detect the update before opening the app. When the app opens, it might create a new note for today, overwriting the computer's entry. Fortunately, Logseq has a &lt;code>bak&lt;/code> folder for backups, so the data can be recovered, but it requires manual intervention outside the program.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="git-syncing">Git Syncing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before switching to a Mac, I tried another approach using Git to sync notes due to iCloud’s issues on Windows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Logseq has built-in Git version control capabilities, automatically committing changes at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). On the PC, you can configure Git hooks to automatically push commits to a remote repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On iOS, I used a-shell and Shortcuts to pull and sync files. Specifically, I used Shortcuts to pull changes when opening Logseq and to commit and push changes when closing the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This method allowed syncing notes across devices, but simultaneous edits could still cause issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the workflow seemed feasible, the actual experience was subpar due to various issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>My remote repository was on GitHub, and pulling changes on mobile often failed due to network issues, preventing the mobile app from syncing to the latest version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conflicts could arise, requiring manual resolution using Git, which necessitated user intervention.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="syncing-between-android-and-pc-using-google-drive">Syncing Between Android and PC Using Google Drive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I switched back to an Android phone, iCloud was no longer an option, so I turned to Google Drive. That’s when I realized that most cloud storage services on Android don’t offer native two-way folder syncing like iCloud. To achieve this, I had to use third-party apps (e.g., AutoSync). However, these services had significant drawbacks. First, they required granting full read/write permissions for cloud storage, raising security concerns. Additionally, syncing was slow and prone to failure, as it relied on periodic syncing tasks to fetch the latest files from Drive. After a few attempts, I uninstalled the app and revoked its permissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="official-sync-feature">Official Sync Feature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All the aforementioned methods essentially rely on external systems or software to sync the contents of the note folder. This inevitably creates a problem: Logseq itself is unaware of the syncing process or whether the files have been fully synced. Each time the app is opened, it assumes the files are already synced and processes them accordingly. This can lead to simultaneous read/write operations between Logseq and the external system, causing issues. This is the root cause of many of the sync problems mentioned above.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Side note: Obsidian has many internal plugins for syncing. Could Logseq provide a similar plugin-based syncing solution? Why are there so few sync-related plugins for Logseq? Perhaps the developers haven’t opened up the necessary APIs for such capabilities?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After struggling with syncing on Android, I finally decided to pay for the official sync feature. Logseq now offers a sync service that, although still in beta, works seamlessly across devices (Android, Mac, iPad). For just $5 per month, you can enable it. Detailed setup instructions are available in the &lt;a href="https://blog.logseq.com/how-to-setup-and-use-logseq-sync/">official documentation&lt;/a>. Payment options include credit cards (Visa/Master), Google Pay, or PayPal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The official sync feature supports syncing up to 10 graphs. On forums like v2ex, some users share their sync slots to save money. While each graph is encrypted with a separate password, sharing slots poses security risks. For instance, creating a graph for someone else requires sharing your account credentials. Additionally, it seems that removing a remote graph doesn’t require a password, potentially allowing malicious deletion of data.&lt;/p>

However, while writing a blog, I discovered that after updating Hugo, there were issues running it locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-log" data-lang="log">ERROR deprecated: site config key paginate was deprecated in Hugo v0.128.0 and subsequently removed. Use pagination.pagerSize instead.
ERROR deprecated: resources.ToCSS was deprecated in Hugo v0.128.0 and subsequently removed. Use css.Sass instead.
ERROR deprecated: .Site.IsMultiLingual was deprecated in Hugo v0.124.0 and subsequently removed. Use hugo.IsMultilingual instead.
ERROR deprecated: .Site.Author was deprecated in Hugo v0.124.0 and subsequently removed. Implement taxonomy &amp;#39;author&amp;#39; or use .Site.Params.Author instead.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>From the error messages, it’s clear that Hugo introduced breaking changes in the update. After the upgrade, some fields and methods were directly removed. At first glance, the error messages seemed helpful, offering alternative fields. However, after making those replacements, I realized it wasn’t as simple as it seemed. The site wouldn’t run. So, I had to downgrade Hugo to its previous version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the steps I followed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>brew info hugo&lt;/code> to find the repository and path of the application you want to downgrade.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;img src="https://scottyeung.top/my-images/202503151706238.png" alt="">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In my case, I used a mirror. The original repo is hosted on GitHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to the corresponding repository on GitHub and locate the relevant file.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The file path can be referenced here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/h/hugo.rb">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/h/hugo.rb&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the commit history of this file and find the commit ID of the version you want to downgrade to.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Based on the commit ID, you can identify the version, which is usually submitted by the bot &lt;code>BrewTestBot&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you have the commit ID, you can retrieve the URL of the formula file and its content.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Example: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/2fd8dba871a6a5412fa7c00b12ac99b5738cd199/Formula/h/hugo.rb">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/2fd8dba871a6a5412fa7c00b12ac99b5738cd199/Formula/h/hugo.rb&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raw content: &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/2fd8dba871a6a5412fa7c00b12ac99b5738cd199/Formula/h/hugo.rb">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/2fd8dba871a6a5412fa7c00b12ac99b5738cd199/Formula/h/hugo.rb&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replace the commit ID and app name accordingly to get the correct URL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to some online guides, you can directly install using the URL with &lt;code>brew install url&lt;/code>.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>However, when I tried this, I encountered an error: &lt;code>Error: Non-checksummed download of hugo formula file from an arbitrary URL is unsupported! brew extract or brew create and brew tap-new to create a formula file in a tap on GitHub instead.&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instead, I copied the formula file’s content, saved it locally, and then installed it using &lt;code>brew install ./hugo.rb&lt;/code>. The installation was successful.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>After successfully downgrading the Homebrew application, you can lock the version using &lt;code>brew pin hugo&lt;/code> to prevent future upgrades.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>After encountering the failure with the &lt;code>install url&lt;/code> method, I found &lt;a href="https://www.ericbariaux.com/posts/brew_rollback/">another approach&lt;/a> for downgrading, which also seemed feasible. However, I ran into errors while executing the build script locally. Still, it might be worth referencing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here’s an explanation of these commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These four Homebrew commands aim to create a local tap and install a specific version of CMake. Let me explain each command:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-brew-tap-new-userlocal-cmake">1. &lt;code>brew tap-new $USER/local-cmake&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This command creates a new tap (software repository). &lt;code>$USER&lt;/code> is an environment variable representing the current username, so the tap will be named &amp;quot;your-username/local-cmake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: Create a new local tap to store custom formulae.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Result&lt;/strong>: A new tap structure is created at &lt;code>$(brew --repo)/Library/Taps/$USER/homebrew-local-cmake&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="2-brew-tap-homebrewcore---force">2. &lt;code>brew tap homebrew/core --force&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This command forcibly taps Homebrew's core repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: Ensure the homebrew/core repository (which contains official formulae) is properly tapped. The &lt;code>--force&lt;/code> flag ensures the action is performed even if the tap already exists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Result&lt;/strong>: Ensures access to the formulae in homebrew/core, which is necessary for extracting the CMake formula.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="3-brew-extract---version3311-cmake-userlocal-cmake">3. &lt;code>brew extract --version=3.31.1 cmake $USER/local-cmake&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This command extracts a specific version of the CMake formula from homebrew/core to your local tap.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: Extract the CMake formula for version 3.31.1 from the official repository and place it in your newly created local tap.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Result&lt;/strong>: A &lt;code>cmake@3.31.1.rb&lt;/code> formula file is created in your local tap.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="4-brew-install-userlocal-cmakecmake3311">4. &lt;code>brew install $USER/local-cmake/cmake@3.31.1&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This command installs the specific version of CMake from your local tap.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: Use the extracted formula to install CMake version 3.31.1.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Result&lt;/strong>: CMake version 3.31.1 is installed on your system.&lt;/li>

Since I hadn't updated my blog in the past two months and was too busy to check, I hadn't noticed the issue. After publishing a new post yesterday, I realized today that the view count was still zero. I opened &lt;a href="https://app.follow.is/share/feeds/55149012216215581">Follow&lt;/a> and found that Follow was also having trouble fetching the RSS feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I received the email, I tested the RSS feed locally, and it opened without any issues. Then I checked the error logs provided by NJU-LUG Blogroll, which indicated a timeout error. My initial guess was that there might be an issue with the CDN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I logged into Upyun to inspect the CDN settings and eventually discovered a configuration option for &lt;strong>Acceleration Regions&lt;/strong>. The default setting was &amp;quot;Domestic Acceleration,&amp;quot; which routes overseas requests to domestic CDN nodes. It seemed the problem lay here—overseas access (e.g., GitHub Action) might have been unable to reach Upyun's domestic CDN nodes recently, resulting in timeouts and the inability to fetch the RSS feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://scottyeung.top/my-images/202412291319630.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After changing the configuration to &amp;quot;Global Acceleration,&amp;quot; I retried fetching the RSS feed in Follow, and the issue was resolved successfully.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Blog/">Blog</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/GitHub/">GitHub</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/rss/">rss</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Notes/">Notes</category></item><item><title>Walking on Thin Ice</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/walking-on-thin-ice/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/walking-on-thin-ice/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:20:02 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>Because I had a bit of leave left, I wrapped up my workdays for the year yesterday. Of course, that only means I don’t have to physically go to the office for the rest of the year—there’s still work to be done. In fact, I even had to troubleshoot issues and respond to messages from U.S. colleagues at noon on Saturday due to the time difference. It’s been a while since I last updated, so I thought I’d take this chance to summarize and vent a little about work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m about to hit the one-and-a-half-year mark as a rookie in the workplace. Looking back on this time, the overwhelming feeling is—panic. Anxiety and panic. Worrying about not being able to handle tasks, worrying about potential issues, worrying about system failures or financial risks. It truly feels like walking on thin ice, where every step has to be taken with extreme caution, fearing that I might step into a trap. On one hand, there are many external factors beyond my control; on the other hand, the scope of the business systems is just too vast, with countless edges and corners where details can be easily overlooked. It feels like no matter how careful you are, problems can still arise—some of which might be completely out of your control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pressure-of-not-making-mistakes">The Pressure of &amp;quot;Not Making Mistakes&amp;quot;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main reason for this constant panic is the pressure of &amp;quot;not making mistakes.&amp;quot; In a large company, the cost of making a mistake is just too high. One system failure or financial loss could directly result in a poor performance review—or even being &amp;quot;let go.&amp;quot; Even if it doesn’t come to that, in such a competitive and cutthroat environment, a single mistake can significantly impact your chances of promotion and career development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this isn’t just an issue in the tech industry. A few days ago, I read a news story about a lawyer who forgot to inform their client to pay an additional 5 yuan in court fees. The client sued them for arbitration, and the lawyer ended up compensating over a million yuan. The legal profession is another high-risk field. This made me realize even more deeply that some professions simply have an incredibly high cost of error—you just can’t afford to make mistakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blurred-lines-between-work-and-life">Blurred Lines Between Work and Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apart from the pressure of &amp;quot;not making mistakes,&amp;quot; what exhausts me the most is how hard it is to separate work from life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, there’s the issue of working hours. Late nights at work have become the norm. Sometimes, I work overtime until after 10 p.m., and by the time I get home, there’s barely enough time to wash up and sleep—leaving no room for personal life. Even on rare occasions when I leave work early, there’s always someone who needs to reach out to me for something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, everyone plays a role in the overall business chain. If you don’t complete your task, it holds up others; conversely, if someone else doesn’t finish their task, you’re stuck too. To avoid delays, you sometimes end up disturbing others at inconvenient times, like evenings or weekends. Of course, this kind of disturbance is mutual—I often get bombarded with messages during my own downtime as well. Over time, the boundaries between work and life become increasingly blurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the end of the day, work is still just work. We work to earn money, and we earn money to live. My future goal is to find a less stressful industry or role where mistakes are more tolerable and the pressure isn’t so high. &lt;del>Of course, the ideal scenario would be not having to work at all.&lt;/del> Who knows when I’ll finally be able to live off passive income? Hopefully, it won’t take until retirement (though there’s no guarantee I’ll even make it to retirement).&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Life/">Life</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Essay/">Essay</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Work/">Work</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Complaints/">Complaints</category></item><item><title>Arc Bookmark Export</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/export-arc-bookmarks/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/export-arc-bookmarks/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 20:02:42 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>Recently, I've been thinking about switching back to Edge browser from Arc. Naturally, changing browsers requires migrating usage history data from Arc, with bookmarks (or &amp;quot;Pined Tabs&amp;quot; as Arc calls them) being the most important. However, after searching around, I couldn't find an export option. A quick search revealed that the Arc browser, which uses the Chromium engine, indeed lacks a bookmark export feature (&lt;a href="https://sspai.com/post/81942">The shame of Arc browser's user experience: unable to export saved websites&lt;/a>)...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to an article on SSPai, the browser itself does not have a bookmark export function. You can only find the data file in the application directory, specifically at &lt;code>/Users/{your username}/Library/Application Support/Arc/StorableSidebar.json&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://scottyeung.top/my-images/202410012019733.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exported data file contains the URLs and titles of the Pined tabs. However, this JSON data format cannot be directly imported into Chrome/Edge browsers and needs to be converted into the corresponding HTML format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the comments section of the SSPai article, someone posted a conversion page, but after trying it out, I found that the group names and hierarchy of the bookmarks were lost. So, I wrote one myself. You can try it out. Just find the file at the path mentioned above, copy the text content, and paste it into the webpage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The address is: &lt;a href="https://scottyeung.top/arc-bookmarks-export/">https://scottyeung.top/arc-bookmarks-export/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Supports exporting bookmarks according to hierarchical grouping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will also export open tabs and fixed application tabs on the Pined Tab
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>However, these exported tabs are not distinguished and are placed at the bottom of the outermost group&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, it's best to close any open tabs in the Arc browser before exporting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>source: &lt;a href="https://leetcode.cn/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color/description/">3127. Make a Square with the Same Color&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>difficulty: easy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are given a 2D matrix grid of size 3 x 3 consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a 2 x 2 square where all cells are of the same color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Return true if it is possible to create a 2 x 2 square of the same color, otherwise, return false.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="constraints">Constraints:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>grid.length == 3&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>``grid[i].length == 3`&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>grid[i][j] is either 'W' or 'B'&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The problem can be transformed into determining whether there exists a 2 * 2 matrix within a 3 * 3 matrix that contains 3 or 4 identical elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that the matrix is only 3 * 3, it can be directly divided into 4 blocks, and we can simply check whether any of these 4 blocks meet the condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kotlin">Kotlin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Directly check which blocks each point belongs to. However, the if statements for these checks are quite ugly (after writing one, I ended up using GitHub Copilot to generate the rest).&lt;/p>

We had a lot to talk about. The railway department, a traditional state-owned enterprise, doesn't seem much different from the unit system in terms of work. Although there are indeed professional aspects to the job, the core elements seem to be party building and publicity. All these things sound very interesting to someone like me who works in the volatile internet industry. Many of the so-called stereotypes about the system are, to some extent, quite reasonable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most memorable part of our conversation was about work and promotion. I asked my classmate out of curiosity, &amp;quot;What growth and gains have you achieved over the years of working? Or what would you say is your core competitiveness when it comes to promotions or job-hopping?&amp;quot; The point of my question was to understand what skills my classmate has acquired and improved in his work, what he possesses that others don't, or what he has that others also have. (Naturally, I thought about what could be shown off in a job interview when job-hopping.) However, his answer was: connections, face-time, and the skills that could be related to, perhaps, article writing, video editing, and being able to do anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After hearing his answer, my first thought was that these things are only applicable within this system. If one leaves this system, wouldn't all these be wasted? But why would one leave this system? As my classmate said, once you enter the unit, you basically won't be fired, and they take care of your life, old age, sickness, and death. Under such circumstances, the individual and the collective are firmly tied together. The collective promises not to abandon the individual, and the individual is not willing to leave the collective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having worked for less than a year, I honestly feel a bit tired of working in the internet industry, dealing with a makeshift team, doing uninteresting tasks, and often under great pressure. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the company or the industry, but the turnover rate is really high. Some of those who joined at the same time as me have already left. Where can they go? But at least they can leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know the state-owned enterprise system is attractive, but I really can't accept a job without an exit mechanism. What if something inappropriate happens? Can I find a job after I quit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, if all else fails, there's always the civil service to fall back on. Could it be that the final destination is the civil service? It seems I can start brushing up on some questions.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Essay/">Essay</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Rants/">Rants</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Miscellaneous/">Miscellaneous</category></item><item><title>Reading Notes on 'Glucose Revolution'</title><link>https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/control-sugar/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottyeung.top/en/2024/control-sugar/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 16:25:47 +0800</pubDate><author>yeungyeah@qq.com (YeungYeah)</author><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36707112/?_dtcc=1">Douban: Glucose Revolution&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="notes">Notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Chapter 13 Part 2 What are the dangers of glucose peaks&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lowering glucose peaks can prevent the occurrence of inflammation, thereby reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 15 7 From Head to Toe How Glucose Peaks Make Us Sick&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the long run, the formation process of glucose peaks can cause oxidative stress, glycation, inflammation, and excessive insulin response, leading to various chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, arthritis, depression, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Too much glucose can stop mitochondria from working, and then energy production will be affected, resulting in us feeling extremely tired.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 17 8 Tip 1 Correct Eating Order&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you eat foods containing starch, fiber, sugar, protein, and fat in a certain order, you can not only reduce your overall glucose peak by 73%, but also reduce your insulin peak by 48%. And this is true whether or not you have diabetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>So, what is the correct order of eating? That is, eat fiber first, then protein and fat, and finally starch and sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 18 9 Tip 2 Add a Green Appetizer Before Each Meal&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you really have to wait, don't exceed 3 hours. This is because fiber usually takes 2 hours to pass through the stomach and upper small intestine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 20 11 Tip 4 Smooth Blood Sugar Curve After Breakfast&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Breakfast is the worst time to eat sugar and starch foods, but most people only eat sugar and starch foods for breakfast.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 23 14 Tip 7 Drink Some Vinegar Before Eating&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Drinking a big glass of water mixed with a tablespoon of vinegar a few minutes before eating sweets will make the subsequent glucose and fructose curves smoother. In this way, appetite will be suppressed, and more fat will be burned at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Drinking vinegar juice within 20 minutes before or after meals, or drinking it while eating, has a similar effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chapter 24 15 Tip 8 Get Moving After Meals&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Now, you know the magical combination of eating sweets without causing a surge in glucose in the body: drink vinegar juice before meals, and exercise more after meals.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Some excerpts and notes from reading &amp;quot;The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="knowing-is-not-the-same-as-doing">Knowing is not the same as doing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Financial success is not a hard science, but a soft skill - how you do it is more important than how much knowledge you have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An individual investor's willingness to take risks depends on early personal experiences. What determines the outcome in investing is not intelligence, not education or experience, but the time and place where a person is born - &lt;strong>purely luck factors&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="survival-first">Survival first&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Getting rich requires a spirit of adventure, an optimistic attitude, and the courage to let go. But what needs to be done to keep wealth is completely opposite to adventure. Keeping wealth requires humility and awe, a clear understanding of how quickly wealth comes and how easily it goes. Keeping wealth requires frugality and acknowledging that part of the wealth you have comes from luck, so don't expect to replicate past successes indefinitely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survival should be the basis of all your strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No return is worth the risk of losing everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only take advantage of the value of compound interest if you survive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="tail-events">Tail events&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tail events have a huge impact in these areas. These low-frequency, high-impact minority events become the main factors determining the outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;What matters is not whether you are right or wrong,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;financial tycoon&amp;quot; George Soros once said, &amp;quot;but how much you can make when you are right, or how much you will lose when you are wrong.&amp;quot; Even if you are wrong half the time, you can still win in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="money-and-time">Money and time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The greatest intrinsic value of money is that it gives you the ability to control your own time - there is no exaggeration in this statement. The reason why you can gradually gain a certain degree of independence and autonomy from the process of wealth accumulation is that the wealth you accumulate gives you stronger control over what you can do and when you can do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don't have much control over time, you have to accept opportunities that are not good enough, but if you have enough time, you can wait for better opportunities to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="facing-the-unexpected">Facing the unexpected&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The truth you should learn from unexpected events is: unexpected things happen every day. We should not take past events as a guide to future possibilities; in the face of unexpected events, we should acknowledge this - we know nothing about what will happen in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the face of the unexpected, safety margins need to be set. The purpose of the safety margin is to make prediction unnecessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If something has a 95% chance of success, the remaining 5% failure rate means that at some point in your life, you will definitely encounter failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save money. Just save. Saving money doesn't need any specific reason. It's a good thing to save for a car, a down payment, or a sudden illness, but one of the best reasons to save is for those unpredictable or undefined things. Everyone's life is made up of a series of surprises. In the worst moments of life, a substantial savings without a specific purpose can provide a hedge for the inevitable surprises.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-cost-of-investment">The cost of investment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The success of investment requires investors to pay a corresponding price, but the measure of this price is not money, but volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret - these costs are easily overlooked by you if you are not the one facing them directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all volatility is a cost, not a penalty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Most of the costs to be paid in finance are unpriced. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the financial world. They are usually worth your bill, but you should see them as a cost (to be paid for good things), not a penalty (to be avoided at all costs).&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="choices-vary-from-person-to-person">Choices vary from person to person&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When a commentator on CNBC tells you &amp;quot;you should buy this stock,&amp;quot; remember that they don't know who you are. Are you a teenager who plays stocks as a game, an elderly person with a limited budget who has lost a spouse, or a hedge fund manager who wants to boost performance before the end of the quarter? Should we think that these three people have the same priority in thinking and believe that the trading price of a stock, no matter how high, is reasonable for each of them?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-temptation-of-pessimistic-attention">The temptation of pessimistic attention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If a person who has always been smart tells me that the price of the stock he chose will increase 10 times next year, I will consider it a dream without hesitation. But if a person who is always confused tells me that the price of a stock I hold will plummet because the company is exposed to fraudulent accounting, I will put down all my work and listen carefully to every word he says.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Progress happens too slowly to be noticed, but setbacks happen too quickly to be ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to data from the National Institute of Health, since 1965, the age-specific death rate from heart disease in the United States has dropped by more than 70%. A 70% drop means that 500,000 lives are saved each year. Compare this with the population of some big cities to get a sense of how many lives are saved each year. But because this process progresses slowly, it attracts less attention than the losses caused by sudden events such as terrorist attacks, plane crashes, or natural disasters. Even if the United States were to experience 5 Katrina hurricanes a week - imagine how much attention that would attract - the total number of deaths in a year would not offset the number of lives saved each year behind the 70% drop over the past half-century.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="authors-philosophy">Author's philosophy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Be humble when things are going in the right direction; be understanding or sympathetic when things are going in the wrong direction. This is because nothing is as good or bad as it seems. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are real and hard to discern, so keep this in mind whether you're evaluating yourself or others. If you can respect the power of luck and risk, you're more likely to focus on what you can really control and find the right reference points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most investors, dollar-cost averaging into low-cost index funds will be the highest probability of long-term investment success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the field of investment, there is almost no relationship between effort and results. This is because the world is driven by tail events - a few variables are the source of most returns. No matter how hard you invest, as long as you miss two or three opportunities that can completely turn the situation around, your returns won't be too outstanding. But on the other hand, as long as you're lucky and seize these opportunities, even if you don't invest seriously at ordinary times, you can easily get rich. As long as you grasp a few key points that are crucial to the success of your strategy, even the simplest investment strategy will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>High savings rate, patience, and an optimistic attitude that the global economy will continue to create value over the next few decades.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/posts/">posts</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Reading/">Reading</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Money/">Money</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Investment/">Investment</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Notes/">Notes</category><category domain="https://scottyeung.top/en/tags/Life/">Life</category></item></channel></rss>
